**Activity 5**

First I checkedout the rebase branch and ran this:
![Activity 5 Screenshot 1](screenshots/activity5_rebase_sc2.png "Activity 5 Screenshot 1") so that the commits in rebase branch were ordered after commits in develop branch

Then I checkedout the develop branch and called rebase to move C1, C2 after C4 on develop branch:

![Activity 5 Screenshot 2](screenshots/activity5_rebase_sc1.png "Activity 5 Screenshot 2")  as shown C1 and C2 commits now go after C4
